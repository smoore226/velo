/*Write a C++ console program that calculates the average acceleration of two velocities. Average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by elapsed time.

ave_acceleration = (velocity_final - velocity_initial) / elapsedTime

Your program should prompt the user to input the initial velocity, the final velocity, and the elapsed time. Store these values into variables of the appropriate datatype. 
It should then compute the average acceleration and display the results in a pleasing format.

The units for velocity are meters / second (m/s). The unit for time is seconds (s). The units for acceleration are m/s/s. 
You can ignore units in your C++ code, but it is good to include them in your output statements so the user knows what the program is doing.*/
